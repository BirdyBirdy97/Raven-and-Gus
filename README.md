# Raven-and-Gus
Aaniin, biindigeg!

Hello, welcome!

This is my personal side gig's website, I've spent about 25 hours on it as of April 2, 2022.
Raven and Gus Beads is my first full-fledged website and is included in my portfolio. If you've come to look at my skill level, please take a look around and enjoy as this is my baby :)

I'm always updating this website, either with new work or more features that I've learned, making this website a pretty good indicator of what I'm capable of with CSS and HTML5. 

The main page looks a little blank, but all of my code is in the other branches to keep it clean and organized.

Miigwetch/Thank you for your interest in Raven and Gus Beads and/or my coding ability!
